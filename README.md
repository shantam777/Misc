# Misc
Misc collection of programs I've made for problem solving purposes. Questions are from various sources like Morgan Stanley Codeathon 2015,
Google APAC test, Google interview questions etc.

It's been quite some time since I made these, hence instead of vectors you'll find simple arrays and C-style strings instead of the
C++ ones as I didn't know much about them back then.
